        Hi, my name is Anguit Clie Regine E. my parents call me "liling" but when they are  angry they call me "Clie Regine!" and I'm 18 years old.
    My birthday is on <a href="./Activity3.html">August 03, 2007</a>. I currently live at Purok Gloria, Ipil Heights, Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay
    but my permanent address is at Kipit, Titay, Zamboanga Sibugay where my parents lived. My parents are Gabriel Anguit Jr. the youngest and
    only son of my grandmother Erlinda Anguit and my mother is Crezel Eguia the second daughter of my grandparents Crispin and Winefrida Eguia.
