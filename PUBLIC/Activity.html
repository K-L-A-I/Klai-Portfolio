<h1> HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE (HTML)</h1>

<h2> Is responsible of the content of the Website</h2>

<p> 
    First paragraph. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and 
    structure content on the web.It provides the basic building blocks for webpages by defining 
    elements like headings, paragraphs,link,images,and multimedia.HTML uses a sytem of tags 
    and attributes to mark up content,enabling browers to interpret and render it visually for user. 
    For example,the p tag defines a paragraph,while the a tag creates hyperlinks,making HTML 
    the backbone of web navigation andcontent presentation.HTML is a foundation technology of the 
    web and works seamlessly with CSS (Cascading style sheets) for styling and JavaScript for 
    interactivity.it is designed to be both human-readable and machine-interpredable,allowing 
    developsers to build structured documents.With advancements like HTML5,the language has 
    incorporated support for rich media,such as video,and interactive elements,without 
    requiring addtional plugings. this has made HTML more versatile and intergral to modern web 
    development.

<h1> CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)</h1>

<h2> Is responsible of the style of the website</h2>

<p> 
  Second paragraph. cascading style sheets (css) is a style sheet language used to
  describe the visual presentation of a documents witten in markup languages like HTML.
  CSS allows developers to separate content from design by specifying dtyle such as colors,
  fonts,layout,and spacing this sepration enables more effcient and consistent design management,
  as changes to sytle can be made in one place and applied across multiple pages or elements.
  CSS operates in a cascading manner,meaning that style can be layered and priotizied based on
  the rules of inheritance and specificity,giving developers finr-grained control over the 
  apperance of we content CSS is an essential part of modern web development because it enchnace
  the user exprience by making web pages visually appeling and interactive. it support renposive 
  desgin,enbaling website to adpt seamlessly to diffirent device and screen size.
  Addtionally CSS can be applied inline(within HTML elements), internally (in the style tag),
  or xternally (via linked,css files), with external stylesheets being the most common
  and scalable approach. advance features of CSS, such asanimations,transition,and grid or 
  flrxbox layout,allows developers tocreate dynamic and sophisticated web design without 
  relying heavl on javascript 
<p>

<h1> JAVASCRIPT (JS)</h1>

<h2> Is responsible of the functionality of the website</h2>

<p> 
  JavaScript is a website and widely-use programming language primaly design for creating
  interactive and dynamic wen application.Is is a core technology of the World Wide Web, 
  along side HTML and CSS ,enabling developers to build responsive udeer interfaces and 
  add interactive features such as animations, form validations,and real-time updates.
  javascript is excuted in web browers,allowing it to modify the content and behavior.
  of web pages without needing to reload them. this client-side capability has made it indisspensable 
  for modern web development beyond the browers.java script has expanded its reach with platform 
  like node js, whichallows developers to write server-side code. this versability has transformed 
  javascript into a fall-stack languages capable of handling both front-end and back-end development 
  addtionally,it supports numeruos framesworks and libraries such as react,angular and vue 
  js,which stremline the development rocess and help create features-rich applications.
  Is ability to work platforms and its continuos evalution have made 
  JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
